===

[tig](https://github.com/jonas/tig) is a TUI interface for git.

## Usage

`h` is for help.

### Modes

* `d` -- diff view
* `l` -- log view
* `b` -- blame view (`,` -- move to parrent)
* `r` -- refs view
* `s` -- status view
* `y` -- stash view

## Alternatives

None that I know of.

[gitg](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gitg/) and [gitk](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitk) are GUIs on the other hand.
